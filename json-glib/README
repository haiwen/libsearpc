JSON-GLib - A JSON parser for GLib-based libraries and applications
===============================================================================

JSON-GLib implements a full JSON parser using GLib and GObject.

Use JSON-GLib it is possible to parse and generate valid JSON data
structures, using a DOM-like API. JSON-GLib also offers GObject
integration, providing the ability to serialize and deserialize
GObject instances to and from JSON data types.

JSON is the JavaScript Object Notation; it can be used to represent
objects and object hierarchies while retaining human-readability.

GLib is a C library providing common and efficient data types for
the C developers.

GObject is a library providing a run-time Object Oriented type system
for C developers. GLib and GObject are extensively used by the GTK+
toolkit and by the GNOME project.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
In order to build JSON-GLib you will need:

  • pkg-config
  • gtk-doc ≥ 1.13
  • GLib, GIO ≥ 2.26

Optionally, JSON-GLib depends on:

  • GObject-Introspection ≥ 0.9.5

INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build JSON-GLib just run:

  $ ./configure
  $ make all
  # make install

BUGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you find a bug in JSON-GLib, please create a Bugzilla entry here:

  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=json-glib

Attaching:

  • the version of JSON-GLib
    ◦ if it is a development version, the branch of the git repository
  • the JSON data that produced the bug (if any)
  • a small test case, if none of the test units exhibit the behaviour
  • in case of a segmentation fault, a full stack trace with debugging
    symbols obtained through gdb is greatly appreaciated

RELEASE NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Prior to JSON-GLib 0.10, a JsonSerializable implementation could
  automatically fall back to the default serialization code by simply
  returning NULL from an overridden JsonSerializable::serialize_property()
  virtual function. Since JSON-GLib 0.10 this is not possible any more. A
  JsonSerializable is always expected to serialize and deserialize all
  properties. JSON-GLib provides public API for the default implementation
  in case the serialization code wants to fall back to that.

HACKING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JSON-GLib is developed mainly inside a GIT repository available at:

  http://git.gnome.org/browse/json-glib

You can clone the GIT repository with:

  git clone git://git.gnome.org/json-glib

If you want to contribute functionality or bug fixes to JSON-GLib you
can either notify me to pull from your GIT repository or send me a set
of patches using:

  git format-patch master -k -s

or:

  git send-email -k -s

Make sure you always run the test suite when you are fixing bugs. New
features should come with a test unit.
